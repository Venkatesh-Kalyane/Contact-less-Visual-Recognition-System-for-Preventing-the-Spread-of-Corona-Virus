1.Challenge:

Covid-19 has affected the whole world adversely and impacted  not only normal life but also work life. In my office, the security guard used to check body temperature of every employee at entrance during inception stage. As a meticulous observer, I saw and thought that security guardâ€™s life was at risk because of coming into contact of innumerable employees. So, it stimulated me to design a Contact-less Visual Recognition System for Preventing the Spread of Corona Virus.


2.Solution Approach:

According to WHO, preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding the crowded places, keeping distance from others, washing hands with soaps and water often and checking body temperature on regular basis. Everything looks feasible but in future, it is inevitable to go to crowded places like office, market place, school, bank and malls etc. So, designed Contact-less Visual Recognition System will help to find out whether a person is taking preventive measures like wearing mask and having normal body which are imperative to  prevent the spread of Corona Virus.
The Contact-less Visual Recognition System comprises of an Infrared camera which can detect temperature of human body and it is integrated with deep learning model which can detect whether a person is wearing mask or not. It can be installed at entrance of any premises like offices, schools, malls and crowded places. So, not even single person like security guard need not to risk his life.


3.Impacts/Benefits of Idea:

We always heard this saying: Prevention is better than Cure. It is applicable in case of Corona virus too. We need to follow guidelines published by WHO and take preventive measures till the time an effective vaccine for Covid-19 is invented. 

The proposed system can be implemented with Camera/CCTVs having public ip address and installed as a mobile app. The Contact-less Visual Recognition System can be installed in socities, offices, schools, malls and crowded places which would enable to come back to our normal life by taking imperative preventive measures and helps to identify whether a person is affected with Covid-19 or not in intial stage.


4.Target Customers/Industries:

The benefitted audience includes normal and professional people i.e. students, employees, citizens of all ages, small scale and large scale industries.
